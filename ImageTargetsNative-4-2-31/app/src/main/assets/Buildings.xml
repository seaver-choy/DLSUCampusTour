		<location_name>Yuchengco Hall</location_name>
		<location_description>The Don Enrique T. Yuchengco Hall (Building code: Y; also as Yuchengco Hall and Yuch), formerly the Central Administration Building, is a nine-storey neoclassical building located within the campus of De La Salle University in the district of Malate in the city of Manila. It was built on the former location of the Br. Athanasius Gym (now the Enrique Razon Sports Center) in the year 2000 to house the central administrative offices of the university. Former university president Br. Rolando Dizon FSC referred to the building as the "nerve center of the university as well as the hub of university activities with its theater and teleconference rooms." A special feature of the building is the controlled central computer for building automation, particularly in the air-conditioning and fire protection systems. The building has an art gallery on the second floor and a three-storey state-of-the-art auditorium on top. It was completed in the year 2002 and inaugurated on August 15 of the same year. Since its completion, the Yuchengco Hall has been featured on the background design of the University's ID cards.

			The building was constructed through the assistance of Ambassador Alfonso Yuchengco, Philippine Permanent Representative to the United Nations and Chairman of the Yuchengco Center. The building was named the Don Enrique T. Yuchengco Hall in honor of his father. The building was previously used by the College of Education; the College has since moved to the Br. Andrew Gonzalez Hall.</location_description>

		<location_description>Construction of the Henry Sy Sr. Hall began on December 2, 2010 as part of the university's Centennial Renewal Plan, a project that aims to construct and renovate facilities inside the campus. A 15-floor building, it replaced DLSU's football field with plans for completion by December 2012. It is estimated to cost ₱1.4 billion (US$32.5 million). In line with this, DLSU entered an eight-year agreement with the Philippine Sports Commission. Under the contract, DLSU will fund the ₱7.4 million (US$171,000) renovation of the Rizal Memorial Track and Football Stadium. DLSU will get to use the facilities in return.</location_description>

		<location_name>St. La Salle Hall</location_name>
		<location_description>The St. La Salle Hall (also known as the LS Building) is an H-shaped four-storey structure built in the neoclassical style in the Philippines. It faces Taft Avenue in the area of Malate in Manila. The building, designed by Tomás Mapúa, was built from 1920 to 1924 to serve as the new campus of De La Salle College (now De La Salle University) due to the lack of space of the previous campus in Paco, Manila, and to accommodate its increasing student population. It served as the grade school and high school building back when the college was still offering those levels.

			Originally built as a three-storey structure, a fourth level was added in the 1990s for the residence of the De La Salle Brothers. The ground floor houses the College of Business. Meanwhile, the second floor of the St La Salle Hall houses the Chapel of the Most Blessed Sacrament, as well as the office of the De La Salle Alumni Association in the south wing.

			The structure was severely damaged during the liberation of Manila in World War II. Numerous civilians took refuge in the building for protection. Restoration of the building after the war took two years and cost ₱246,883 (US$5,720). Retrofitting has undergone in the building since January 2011, and is planned to be completed by 2012.

			The LaSallian, the official student newspaper of the university, identifies it as "DLSU's most historic building." It is the only Philippine structure featured in the book 1001 Buildings You Must See Before You Die: The World’s Architectural Masterpieces published by Quintessence Editions Ltd. in 2007.</location_description>

		<location_name>Br. Andrew Gonzalez Hall</location_name>
		<location_description>The Br. Andrew Gonzalez Hall (Building code: A; also known as Gen Ed Building or "A" Building) is a 20 storey academic complex designed by Philip H. Recto Architects for De La Salle University. It is located on a 1,700-square-meter lot between Taft Avenue and Fidel Reyes St. and in front of the Enrique M. Razon Sports Center. Rising to a height of 90 meters, it is said to be the highest educational structure in the Philippines. The building houses the General Education Department, the College of Education and the Asia-Pacific Center for Teachers’ Education and Development (ACTED). The building was formerly referred to as the GE/CED/ACTED Building before being named in honor of Br. Andrew Gonzalez FSC on September 28, 2005. The building was formally inaugurated on March 1, 2007 in celebration of Br. Andrew's 67th birthday. The building was opened for use in May 2006 for the first trimester despite not being completely finished at the time.

			Eduardo G. Fajardo, chairman of the Natividad Galang-Fajardo Foundation, Inc., contributed a significant amount for the construction of the building. Born to a poor family, Fajaro credits his success to education, and contributed various material and buildings to different schools. </location_description>

Trivia
Formerly known as the St. Benilde Hall and before the split of the College of Arts and Sciences, Miguel Building was part of the College of Engineering.
The first computers ever used in DLSU was situated in the Miguel Building – punch cards and yellow paper tape.
The Comm Arts Television Studio was a gift of the Japanese people through the Commemorative Association for the Japan World Exposition.
Houses some labs for the College of engineering because it was an engineering building before and the equipment are too heavy to transfer to Velasco Hall so they retained the labs.

Being a four-storey fully air-conditioned building, the University Library endeavors to provide access to other library collections within Metro Manila that will support the instructional, research, and other bibliographical needs of both students and faculty through its inter-library services, which involve short term loans and document delivery (Consortia).

An additional service that the library provides is the webliography which makes available electronic bibliographies of websites, web pages and web documents such as: DLSU Faculty Webliography, Philippine Biographical Webliographies and Topics Webliography
