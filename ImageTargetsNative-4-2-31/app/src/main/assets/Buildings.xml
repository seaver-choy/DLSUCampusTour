Trivia
Formerly known as the St. Benilde Hall and before the split of the College of Arts and Sciences, Miguel Building was part of the College of Engineering.
The first computers ever used in DLSU was situated in the Miguel Building – punch cards and yellow paper tape.
The Comm Arts Television Studio was a gift of the Japanese people through the Commemorative Association for the Japan World Exposition.
Houses some labs for the College of engineering because it was an engineering building before and the equipment are too heavy to transfer to Velasco Hall so they retained the labs.
